What is metagaming?

    Meta-gaming is using Out of Character knowledge and applying it to an In
    Character situation. A common example of such is reading the name tag above
    a players head and saying their name in the In Character chat to gain their
    attention. You, the player, have seen the name on the screen, but your character
    does not know the person's name.
