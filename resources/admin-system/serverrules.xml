MTA Server Rules - Part I

1. Role play at all times unless you're in admin-jail. Only administrators are allowed to declare a
    situation to be OOC and/or interrupt an RP event.
   
2. Do not deathmatch (DM). You must have a valid role play reason for attacking another player.
	
3. Do not revenge kill (RK). If you reach 0 HP and respawn you are to role play memory loss of 
    events leading up to the death. You cannot retaliate against the person or group that killed you.

4. Do not metagame.
	
5. Do not powergame. In all role play situations both sides must have a say in the out come of
    a situation.
	
6. Do not use cheats, hacks or exploit features or bugs in the script or face a perm ban. Report the
    bug on the forum so it can be corrected.

7. This is an English speaking server. If you wish to speak another language in character (IC),
    go to the Book Emporium, learn that language, press F6 and click 'use' to speak it. If you
    wish to speak another language OOC, do so through private messages (/pm [player name] [message]).

8. Don't mix out of Character (OOC) with In Character (IC). All OOC information is wrapped with
    double brackets ((example)).

9. Respect all other players.
	
10. Do not role play raping another player or paedophilia.

11. Admin jail is OOC punishment therefore you are not allowed to role play in admin jail.
	
12. Do not heal during fights.

13. Do not bunny hop (jumping to get somewhere quicker).

14. Role play car jackings. Pressing the enter button to throw the driver out is not enough.
