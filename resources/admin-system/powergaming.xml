What is powergaming?

    Power-gaming is a term used to describe anything that is an unfeasible 
    situation or performing an action without allowing any other players to
    contest this action and come up with a suitable reaction. An example of
    such would be giving your character super-human strengths that allows it
    to break out of Police handcuffs or using a /me command to say that you 
    knock someone out in one punch. Whenever an action is performed, it must
    always be an attempt. This allows the other player to react to this action.
    Hence Newton's Third Law  - To every action, there is a reaction.
