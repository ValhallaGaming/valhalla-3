What is Psyche?

   Well thats a good question, psyche is a new feature that we have introduced 
   to roleplay. The idea being that no longer will your health be determined by 
   food. The closest thing to psyche is stamina and the idea that if you are low
   on stamina then you are more likely to be slower and be more dependent on food
   and drink, maybe even drugs. 
   
   With this new feature we can allow the possibility for your character to become
   addicted and face moral and financial dillemmas along to real life. You can 
   become dependant on the chosen substance/drink if you consume too much.

   Once your psyche bar has depleted you will then start to see the effects and begin 
   to lose health. It is keeping this bar full that is essential for your character 
   running their daily routines.
