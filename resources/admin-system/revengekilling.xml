What is Revenge Killing?

    Revenge killing is when you seek revenge on another player after being killed.
    This often leads to more and more deathmatching.

    When you're killed you're not allowed to return to that scene or get revenge
    on the player that killed you.

    When you're hospitalized (reach 0HP and respawn) you black out. You are expected
    to role play suffering memory loss as a result of your injuries; you can't
    remember who shot you, hence you can't take revenge on that person.
