What is roleplaying?

    Roleplaying is where you take on the role of another make-belief character. 
    You give that character a personality and their own features. Effecitively,
    all your actions that you undertake whilst playing are the actions that your
    character would take in those circumstances. You can be any type of character
    you want (within reason), such as a Mafia godfather, hitman, officer of the law,
    gang member, businessman, hobo, paramedic or whatever your mind conjures up 
    - Your choice is only limited by your imagination.
	
    One important thing to remember is that DeathMatching occurs when you, the
    player, wants to kill someone in VG.MTA. This can occur due to OOC reasons
    Example: A player is told in the OOC chat that he isn't the friendliest 
    person. That player then seeks to find the player who said that in OOC chat
    and kills them). This is opposed to hospitalizing someone In Character,
    where it is your character that wants to kill the other person, for an IC reason.
