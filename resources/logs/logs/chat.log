[2010-03-07 09:49] [IC: Local Chat] Adam Benjamin: okay
[2010-03-07 09:49] [IC: Local Chat] Randall Himes: It will be directed to BT&R and then be removed from the spot, since this isn't a parking lot.
[2010-03-07 09:49] [IC: Local Chat] Negara Madalin: i want it black

[2010-03-07 09:50] [OOC: Local Chat] Richard Williams: yea
[2010-03-07 09:50] [OOC: Local Chat] Jick Nick: Kinda annoying when you do over 9000 /me's and /do's indicating a trampoline
[2010-03-07 09:50] [OOC: Local Chat] Jick Nick: then an officer walks up to you "Set up a trampoline"
[2010-03-07 09:50] [OOC: Local Chat] John Brenkly: I don't even think that would be possible. Script and model wise.
[2010-03-07 09:50] [IC: Local Chat] Mark Linn: Oh..., so thats why everytime I park here too long it gets towed
[2010-03-07 09:50] [OOC: Local Chat] John Brenkly: Especially in this games physics engine
[2010-03-07 09:50] [IC: Local Chat] Matsuko Kenshin: Damn.. Idiot.. Should learn to drive...
[2010-03-07 09:50] [IC: Local Chat] Randall Himes: If everyone would park his car around here..well, it'd be quite crowdy.

[2010-03-07 09:51] [OOC: Local Chat] Jick Nick: Make the area on the trampoline an invincibility zone
[2010-03-07 09:51] [OOC: Local Chat] John Brenkly: Unless they work it in with the parachute idea somehow.
[2010-03-07 09:51] [IC: Local Chat] Medwin Metz: I know him,my friend Ike.
[2010-03-07 09:51] [OOC: Local Chat] Jick Nick: Yeah, that could work as well.
